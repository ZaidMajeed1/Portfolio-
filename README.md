# Portfolio-
This is a personal portfolio website developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, GSAP, and Three.js. It showcases my web development skills, including modern animations and 3D effects.  The site includes dedicated sections for About Me, Projects, Skills, and Contact, all designed to provide a clean, interactive, and engaging user experience.
